    					<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Hello! Welcome to our website and NITK.<br><span></span><br>Our website started off with the objective of providing all the necessary information a new entrant/ freshman should know about our beloved college NITK ( pronounced Yen Aye Tee Kay ) and finally here it is. Phew!. If you are looking for anything related to our college (except the academics), then look no further because you are at the right place.<br><span></span><br>The main theme of our website is the Life at NITK for any freshman and everything one needs to know before entering the college. This website was designed and created by a bunch of your sophomore seniors with the idea of providing all prerequisites and the do&rsquo;s and do nots a new entrant should know before stepping foot into this institution.<br><span></span><br>And as far as other information such as academics, fees and other official info, its best to gain authorized info from the college's official website. Here is the link : -<br><br> <a href="http://www.nitk.ac.in/" title="">http://www.nitk.ac.in/</a><br></div>

    					<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><strong><u>OUR INSTITUTE</u></strong><br />The National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK) formerly known as Karnataka Regional Engineering College (KREC), is a public <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_college" title="">engineering college</a> at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surathkal" title="">Surathkal</a>, about 20 kilometres north of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangalore" title="">Mangalore</a>. It was founded in 1960 as KREC while today, it is one of the 30 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Technology" title="">National Institutes of Technology</a> in India and is recognised as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_National_Importance" title="">Institute of National Importance</a>. It has a suburban campus, in close proximity to the Arabian Sea. National Highway 66 runs through the campus and serves as the major mode of access. ( Yes, it&rsquo;s from Wikipedia :P )<br /><br />From our own perspective, this is a wonderful college to be in. Great atmosphere. Great culture. Great opportunities. As you enter, the greenery and the magic in the atmosphere leaves &nbsp;you spellbound instantly. Gives you the motivation to live a full life here. Bid a somewhat tearful farewell to your parents and depart for the hostels.<br /><br />You meet various people in the first two weeks. You find out that though you got a bad-ass rank in JEE, these people are no less. Then you start observing the trend. You start adapting and settling down. Then you start learning. Learning about the various people, their culture and their habits. Finally, you start making friends. Once you have a peer group to call your own, you are all ready to kick start your journey. It's going to be a great run. However, remember not to neglect your academics, and know our institute's vision and mission to compliment your goals and mottos.</div>
